# VBA-challenge

This is the result of my work on Module 2 - VBA Challenge

How I worked on the submission

There are 8 files related to my submission:

VBA script files demonstrating the following:
- Creating headers
- Stock_outputs (Column Creation): Quarterly change, Pecentage change and Total stock volume for each group of stocks
- Conditional formatting
- Greatest and Final (Calculated Values)
- 4 screenshot files reflecting the results

*** Note: Looping across worksheets was not saved in a separate script.
